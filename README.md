# FunPrograms
Just fun quick programs that I make for no reason whatsoever.

Anything in this repository is made by me, unless otherwise specified. No one is allowed to edit, add, or remove anything in this repository without checking with me first. Download the code if you would like to try the programs out for yourself. Anything within the same file has to be downloaded together for the code to run properly (ie. all of the files in the "Are you a Larrie?" folder must be downloaded in order to run the program inside.
